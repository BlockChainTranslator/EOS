Ok, so the title may be a little grandiose, but read the article anyway, you may find yourself buying some EOS tokens after you do.

好吧，这可能有点标题党了，但是，不管怎样，读一读这篇文章，你可能发现自己读了后买了一些 EOS 代币。

Over the last twenty-five years I’ve built, bought and sold several businesses. I’ve also had my series 7 and 63 licenses and I’m pretty good at analyzing opportunities. It’s how I have made my living. So, I am looking at this opportunity from a financial and business perspective only, not the tech. There are plenty of other sources you can review for that. I am assuming the tech will work as outlined in the white paper and as presented by the founders in several interviews and presentations. Based on my research, announcements made by large adopters, and the hundreds of millions in joint, private equity deals Block.one has signed with Mike Novogratz and Eric Schmidt, I have every reason to believe the tech is great. Mike is a billionaire hedge fund manager and Eric is the ex-executive Chairman of Google and one of the richest people in the world. I think it’s safe assume they did their homework prior to making their financial commitments.

过去25年来，我创办，收购，也卖掉过几家公司。我拥有 Series 7 和 Series 63 的证书，我非常擅于分析机会；这就是我赚钱的方式。所以，我只是从商业角度来看待这个机会，而不是从技术角度。对此，你可能会通过很多其它的渠道或资源进行了解。我假设技术会如白皮书里写的以及创始人的采访和路演所讲的那样发挥作用。根据我的研究、大型公司对其的接纳、上亿美元的投入、还有私人资产交易商 Block.one 已经和 Mike Novogratz 和 Eric Schmidt 签约，我非常有理由相信这个技术是非同一般的。Mike 是资产达十亿的对冲基金经理，Eric 是前 Google 的执行主席，也是世界上最富有的人之一。我认为这是安全的假设：他们在作出投资之前已经做过了功课。

So, what makes this investment so interesting and potentially profitable? Well, several things, but let’s start with the team. Yeah, I know, everybody says “The team”. Skip this part if you want to, but all three; Dan Larimer, Brendan Blumer and Brock Pierce have built successful platforms and businesses in the past. Mr. Larimer, the CTO, built Bitshares and Steemit, both top 50 coins based on Market Capitalization and very successful in their own right. Dan is widely regarded as a visionary programmer and he is the developer of the block-chain technology Graphene, which powers both his previous projects. Mr. Blumer and Mr. Pierce have also built several successful businesses, details of which can be found online. Trust me, both are impressive, but I don’t want to waste time singing their praises. Just look at the information below and you will see they have already made some brilliant moves.

那么，是什么使得这个投资如此吸引人，而且是有潜力获得回报的？我觉得有几件事情，但是我们先从这个团队讲起。Dan Larimer, Brendan Blumer 和 Brock Pierce 已经搭建了成功的平台和业务。作为 CEO 的 Dan Larimer 之前开发过 Bitshares 和 Steemit（两个基于区块链的平台），它们的市值都在前 50 内，而且凭自身就运行的特别好。Dan 被普遍认为是一位有远见的程序员，他是区块链技术 Graphene 的开发者，这为他前两个项目提供了很大的帮助。Blumer 和 Pierce 也经营过几家成功的公司，具体细节在网上都可以查到。相信我，两个人都给人留下不一般的印象，但是我不想浪费时间说他们的各种好。我们来看看他们都做了些什么。

341 Dutch Auctions. Whoever decided to do a Dutch Auction type ICO should be rewarded with an additional pile of tokens. Google is the only other company I can remember doing this, but they only did it for one day. It essentially allows Block.one, the developers of EOS, to receive a higher price for their EOS tokens as they prove out the tech and increase awareness. What’s the impact of this type ICO? Cash! mounds and mounds of cash! This provides Block.one with an, almost, absurd amount of liquidity and has made it the most successful ICO EVER! They are still selling 2,000,000 tokens every 23 hours for 20 million at the current price. To date, they have had 240 auctions and have another 110 to go. Auctions end June 1st. I estimate they have already raised 2.3 billion before their auctions are over.

341 天荷兰拍卖。无论谁决定进行一场荷兰拍卖式的 ICO 都应该被奖励一部分额外的代币。Google 是唯一我记得做这个的公司，但是他们只做了一天。当他们证实了这一技术并且这一认识不断扩大的时候，这基本上让Block.one（EOS 的开发方）从 EOS 代币中获得更高的价格。这种类型的 ICO 会有什么样的结果？现金！成堆成堆的。这为 Block.one 提供了一个几乎荒谬的现金流，并且使得它成为到目前为止最成功的 ICO。他们仍旧以当前的价格每小时出售 20 万个代币，总值相当于 1800 万到 2000 万美元。到今天，他们已经拍卖了 240 天，还剩下 110 天。拍卖在 2018 年的 6 月 1 号结束。我猜测他们已经募集了 15 亿美元。我认为他们在拍卖结束前将会再募集 23 亿美元。

Another important point to consider is that Block.one only accepts Ethereum as a form of payment for EOS tokens. ETH was 288 a token when they started raising money. Let’s assume they have only sold the amount of ETH they’ve required for business needs, development purposes, marketing and G&A. That means the money they’ve raised, and will raise, could be double, or at least much more than, the 4-billion-dollar amount estimated just based on the appreciation of their Ethereum tokens. They could, potentially, be sitting on 7-to-10 billion dollars’ worth of Ethereum at the end of their auction.

另外一个需要考虑的重点是 Block.one 只接受 ETH 作为对 EOS 代币的支付形式。他们在募集的时候，一枚 ETH 价值 288 美元。让我们假定他们只卖掉了用于业务需求、开发、营销和管理所需的 ETH 数量。那意味着，基于 ETH 的增值他们已经募集的和将要募集的可能要达到 40 亿美元翻一番，或者至少要超过 40 亿美元。在整个拍卖结束时，他们可能拥有价值 70 到 100 亿美元的 ETH。

What does this mean? Power! — Block.one is building a competing platform to Ethereum and could, potentially, be sitting on 5 to 10 million ETH tokens with no real need for them. If you are holding a lot of ETH this should scare the shit out of you! Block.one’s headquarters are in Hong Kong and they were formed in the Cayman Islands, so their Ethereum tokens could potentially be converted to fiat tax free without much fuss. Or, maybe they prefer to hold BTC going forward. ORRRR what if they buy EOS tokens with their ether after their platform launches and their own, native, token is live? They could, significantly, raise the price of EOS tokens, it’s market cap, the profile of the company, and kill the price of ETH at the same time. Maybe Block.one wants the number two spot on Coin Market Cap for EOS. It sure would raise the profile of the founders and benefit them in their future business ventures. We’ve all seen how easy it is to move the market over the last 30 days and how little money it actually takes. Block.one has billions! On top of that, it’s not that far-fetched of an idea. If they think their platform is the future, do you really think they want to keep all their money in the token of their biggest competitor? One they think they are going to be better than and potentially crush. I mean, why would they keep their money in ETH tokens? The answer is they wouldn’t. It would actually be foolish to do so. I’m not the first person to worry about erc20 token ICO’s potentially affecting the price of ETH. It’s been a concern for a while. Block.one’s EOS token sale has been so big, that I think it’s time to really consider what it means to ETH.

这意味着什么？影响力！Block.one 正在搭建一个与以太坊竞争的平台，而且极有可能拥有 500 万到 1000 万枚 ETH 代币，而实际上并不真正需要这些ETH。如果你持有很多 ETH，这可能会把你吓出翔。Block.one 的总部在香港，在开曼群岛注册，所以他们的 ETH 代币可能无需手续费、不费力地兑换成法币。或者，他们更喜欢持有BTC。如果他们的平台上线，自己的原生代币可以发行后，他们用这些 ETH 来买 EOS 代币会怎么样？他们可能会极大地提高 EOS 代币的价格，它的市值以及公司的形象，同时压低 ETH 的价格。也许 Block.one 想让 EOS 成为代币市场份额的老二。这无疑会提升创始人的形象，有益于他们在以后的商业风险投资。我们都已经看到过去的30天里它是如何轻松地推动这个代币市场，以及它实际上花了没多少钱。Block.one 拥有数十亿美元！重要的是，这不是不可实现的。如果他们认为他们的平台就是未来，那么你真的认为他们想把他们所有的钱都换成他们最大的竞争对手的代币吗？答案是：不会。要是这样做的话，真是愚蠢至极。我不是第一个担心 ERC20 代币ICO可能会影响 ETH 的价格的人。一段时间以来，这一直是很多人关心的。Block.one 的 EOS 代币销售如此之多，我觉得是时候真正考虑一下这对 ETH 来说意味着什么。

So, what does all this money provide? Influence, and a lot of it. With this kind of money on the books, the best of the best, in employees, partners, developers, influencers, and just about anyone else that can add value to EOS can be very well compensated and incentivized to work for Block.one and on EOS. This gives them tremendous power in the block chain market and the potential to pull solid talent from other, undercapitalized, projects. They’ve already hired Richard Jung, former CEO of Bithump and a former senior executive at Alibaba to lead development in Korea. They’ve partnered with Mike Novogratz and Eric Schmidt to invest in promising DApps and ventures and bring them, exclusively, to the EOS platform. They’ve also, through Galaxy, invested $30 million in Everipedia. All this, and the EOS platform has not even launched yet. Think about what will happen when the platform launches in June and does everything they said it was going to do. It’s going to be explosive growth and announcement after announcement, after announcement.

那么，这些钱都提供了什么？影响力，非常多的影响力。把这些钱用在员工、合伙人、开发人员、有号召力的人，以及任何能给 EOS 带来价值的人，都会获得非常好的补偿，并且激励他们为 Block.one 工作，从事与 EOS 相关的事情。这给了他们在区块链市场上相当大的影响力，以及有潜力去从其它的项目中吸引优秀的人才。他们已经聘请了 Bithump 前CEO、阿里巴巴前高级执行总裁 Richard Jung 来负责在韩国的发展。他们也与 Mike Novogratz 和 Eric Schmidt 合作投资富有前景的去中心化应用(DApp)以及风险投资活动，把这些应用带到 EOS 平台上进行开发。通过 Galaxy，他们在 Everipedia 上也投资了 3000 万美元。所有这一切的发生，甚至 EOS 平台都还没有正式上线。想象一下，当6月这个平台正式运行并兑现他们之前所说的，将会是一番什么样的景象。这将会是爆炸性的增长。

Another nice benefit to EOS token holders will be the Airdrops. I don’t know that this is how all of them will be handled, but Mike Novogratz’s, Galaxy Digital fund, a joint venture with Block.one, and others, invested $30 million in Everipedia. In lieu of an ICO, EOS token holders will receive an airdrop of Everipedia tokens. Can you imagine the dividends received by EOS token holders if this becomes the method of distribution for Block.one’s invested projects? This could be an enormous benefit to token holders and really encourage them to HODL.

对 EOS 代币的持有者来说，另外一个好处是空投。我不明白这是怎么回事，但是 Mike NOvogratz 和 Block.one 的联合风险投资公司 Galaxy 和其它的风险资本在 Everipedia 上投了3000万美元。替代了 ICO，EOS 代币的持有者将接收 Everpedia 代币的空投。如果这成为 Block.one 投资的项目分发的方法，你能想象 EOS 代币持有者的接收到的这些福利吗？这可能对代币持有者来说是个非常大的福利，并且鼓励他们持有 EOS。

Soon, the daily dilution of existing token holders will end; on June 1st to be exact. Right now, two million EOS tokens are being added to the market every 23 hours via their auctions. This is not the same as inflation because the existing token holders receive no benefit; they are just diluted. After June 1st, if you want to buy EOS tokens, you will have to buy them from an existing token holder on an exchange. If demand stays the same, then the price will have to go up; simple supply and demand.

很快，现有代币的持有者每天的稀释将会结束（**目前的 EOS 是基于 ETH 公链上的，需要转换成 EOS 自己的代币**），的确地说，在 6 月 1 号。现在，200 万个EOS代币每 23 个小时被释放到市场上。这和通胀不是回事，因为现有的代币持有者并没有任何的收益；他们只是被稀释了。6 月 1 号之后，如果你想买 EOS 代币，你得在交易所从持有者手里购买。

So, I have read posts about Block.one just running with the money. This is absurd! Block.one owns 100,000,000 million EOS tokens so they have a vested interest in EOS’s success. Their interests are aligned with the token holders and they have already invested in high profile employees, partnerships and DApp developers. The higher the price of the EOS token, the more their 100,000,000.00 tokens are worth.

我读过很多说 Block.one 只是拿钱跑路的文章。太荒唐了！Block.one 拥有 10 万亿枚 EOS 代币，所以他们对 EOS 的成功是有既得利益的考虑。这些利益是与代币持有人相连的，他们已经在那些优秀的员工、合伙人和 DApp 开发人员上进行了投资。EOS 代币的价格越高，他们的 100 万亿代币就越值钱。

Lastly, do I work for, or have any association with EOS, Block.one or any other associated affiliate? No, I do not. Am I being paid to write any of this? No, I am not. Do I own EOS tokens? Of course, I do, along with a few other promising projects. Would I be sharing any of this analysis and research with you if I didn’t? Probably not. I’m comfortable and a little lazy too… so doing all of this work just to write an article is not my style.

最后，我为 EOS、Block.one 或者与它们有所关联的公司工作吗？没有，我不为他们工作。我是收了钱写这篇文章吗？不是。我持有 EOS 代币吗？当然，还有一些其它前景不错的项目。如果我没有 EOS 代币，我会跟你们分享我的这些分析吗？大概不会。我是个不想操心的人，还有点懒......所以，做这一切只是为了写一篇文章不是我的风格。

In closing, never rely on someone from the internet to make decisions for you about investing. Do your own research. And never, ever invest money you cannot afford to lose. I repeat, never, ever invest money you cannot afford to lose. You are still early, in the world of crypto investing, and there are many fine projects out there. Find a few you believe in and hold on for a while. I think you will be nicely rewarded.

我最后想说的是，不要相信网络上某个人的说辞就作出投资决策。自己做些研究。另外，永远不要投入你承担不了打水漂的钱。再重复一次，永远不要投入你承担不了打水漂的钱。你还处在加密货币投资的初期阶段，而且还有许多好的项目。找一个你相信的，持有它。我觉得你的回报会很不错的。
